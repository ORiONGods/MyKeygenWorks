Buchotto v1.5 GERMAN
http://www.01019freenet.de/chrinke/idemo.html


This is a German program that is made in VB4.
It has a singel serial and you don't really
have to make it more complicated than this:

You notice that a file called REG.DAT is present.
Cool, open it. It says "0". Ok. Lets play and change
it to "1". Save and try. No this method doesn't work
this time. Ok, lets try another one.

Open the .EXE file in HIEW. Press Page Down
6 times until you reach something that looks like this:

r e g . d a t   ..bla...bla...bla...
..................
43691.............35096..........39973

Or to get to this spot, you can search for
"r e g . d a t", but be sure to remember that it
is WideChar. It should look like this:
"72 00 65 00 67 00 2E 0064 00 61 00 74"

Ok, back to cracking, What are those 3 codes...
Well, first thing to try are if those 3 are
all valid codes. Write those down in correct
order and then try the first one. Hmm, nothing
happens. To be sure that it's not singel codes,
enter the next code. No, not right. Ok, now the
next attempt. Add them to a large code. i.e
436913509639973  and try that.

Wow! Now something happened. The big Registration
Button disapeared. Cool! That means we have been
registered. So easy.
