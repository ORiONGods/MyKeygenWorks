Well, I thought to myself today, maybe I can try the new way
of cracking those VB programs that I dont really understand. I have
been storing lots of VB programs on my harddisk and those are taking quite some place now.
Some day earlier I had downloaded tKC new tutorials (15-20) and just opened them up to see what they offered. The 18th tutorial was
7-in-One thing, all from a guy named WIDYA-CL from 2011.

And Tut #1 was about the wonderful games of Pretty Good Solitaire.
So I read it. Hmm that VB trick... cool. I did put those rows in my
WINICE.DAT and restarted. Then I tried on the newest PGS game v5.0
But no luck. Maybe it will go better next time.. after u have read
this tutorial..

Anyway, today I was back in those Transcender apps. Yes, I was
studying.. I tend to be a MCSE. Ok, I had used CORE wonderful
Generic Keygen for this, but that seems to be outdated by now and
I dont see any new upgrades from CORE... :(
So then I thoght, "Why dont u try this new method on this shit?!"

Said and done... here is my solution:

Put in those rows in your WINICE.DAT:

AF6="^s 0 l ffffffff 56,57,8B,7C,24,10,8B,74,24,0C,8B,4C,24,14,33,C0,F3,66,A7;"

Now, use ALT-F6 to check for VB4 and VB5



AF7="^s 0 l ffffffff
FF,75,E0,E8,85,EF,FF,FF,DC,1D,28,10,40,00,DF,E0,9E,75,03;"

And this one for Integer/Real compare search, only VB5


So, after restarting and all that... :)  I fired up one Transcender
program and pressed Enable Program.. You end up with the serial
input screen. Now all of u have a diffrent System_ID, but this 30 sec
trick will have your version regged (ie. no need for COREs keymaker).

Now, enter a dummy serial and 'bpx hmemcpy'
Press F12 7 times and now I pressed ALT-F6.
SoftICE will find those lines... I think it might be the same offset
for you, so mine was: 017f:0f00d9ea
You should now clear the breakpoint set at hmemcpy followed by a new
one att the offset been showed.
Now press F5 to let softICE continue running the program and you will
end up in a very famous location and just do a 'D EDI' and there it is!

I must say a very big thanks to WIDYA-CL for this cool trick.
No need for a reversed DLL file. Just SoftICE...

So this end this tutorial. If u plan to be a MCSE, use Transcender.
And if you intend to be updated with new questions and tips,
BUY the Software! They deserve it to survive... ;)  yeah..
